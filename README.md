# the-monkee-website
milestone project number 1 for the code institute

This is the Monkees website it has cool dark and light colors with black and white images to submerge you into the monkees experience. 
With lots of information about the band members, albums, some sample tracks to listen to and info on where and when you can see them play live.

UX
----------------------

I wanted to keep the design simple with key features that lets fans emerse themselves in monkees culture. And if youre new to the monkees there 
is plenty of info to acquaint yourself with.

In the listen section you are able to play three tracks while checking out the corrisponding vinyl above each tracks
The background image of the vinyl spinning on the turntable is to add a more emerse experience.
The colors of the background image are cool and dark to help you focus more on the music.

Under the listen section are dates and venues where you can catch the monkees playing and links to buy tickets,
as you listen to their musical hits.
